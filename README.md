Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset. Includes Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and cluster visualization
# Day 8 - K-Means Clustering

## âœ… Objective
To perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on Mall Customers data.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
- Mall_Customers.csv

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned data
2. Applied Elbow Method to find best number of clusters
3. Used KMeans to cluster customers
4. Visualized clusters
5. Evaluated using Silhouette Score

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Best K = 5 (from Elbow Method)
- Silhouette Score â‰ˆ 0.55
- Clear segmentation of customer types based on income & spending
